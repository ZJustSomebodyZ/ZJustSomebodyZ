 Hello! i'm Just somebody, literally, that's my username, but i'm also known as **"Protato"**.
 I Like **coding and videogames**.. y'all know, the usual..
 Rn, i'm learning **Python**, plus i'd like to learn **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript** and **C#**
**===========================================================================================**

 ***How i got into coding:***
 I Started coding two years ago, it was roblox's version of **lua**, but i abandoned
 it for a year until i got back into it approximately in november of 2021.
 Some months ago i realized that rbxlua and lua in general weren't useful at all for
 what i wanted to do, so i decided to switch to python, mainly because it had a
 similar syntax to lua, so it'd be easier for me to learn, ***and i don't regret that decision***
 
  Aaaa...nd i guess that's all, i have nothing else to say.. so uhh.. Have a nice day!
